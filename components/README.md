# Task List App

## Overview
The Task List App is a simple, responsive single-page application (SPA) built using React Native and Material UI. The app fetches a list of tasks from a mock API and allows users to mark tasks as complete, providing a visual indication of their status.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to build a responsive application using React Native and Material UI, while effectively managing state and integrating with a mock API.

## Features
- Fetches data from a mock API endpoint: [JSONPlaceholder Todos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos).
- Displays a list of tasks with their titles.
- Includes a header titled "Task List".
- Each task has a "Mark as Complete" button that changes the background color of the task and displays a tick icon when clicked.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile and tablet).

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **Material UI**: For UI components and styling.
- **Expo**: For easy development and deployment of the React Native app.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to fetch data from the API.

## Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-list-app.git
   cd task-list-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Expo development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open the app in a web browser**:
   - Press `w` in the terminal to open the app in a web browser.

## Usage
- The app will display a list of tasks fetched from the mock API.
- Click the "Mark as Complete" button next to any task to change its background color to light green and display a tick icon.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and data fetching.
- **Material UI Integration**: Effectively uses Material UI components for a consistent and modern design.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean, readable, and includes comments where necessary.
- **Responsiveness**: The app is designed to be responsive across different devices.
- **State Management**: Efficiently manages the state of tasks using a single `useState` for all items.
